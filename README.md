**Asset Creations:**
All assets were created by Aaron Bruno with the exception of the sound/music being edited in Audacity. The sound and music files had their treble and bass adjusted, as well as having their pitch changed so that I got the sound I desired.

The "Rubber Ducky Entertainment" logo text, rubber ducky art, and main menu art were created in Adobe Photoshop.
